Try to build a goated FPL roster

find what numbers are truly correlated - what things are truly coordinated by using mathematics. but first, the data, backtest on previous years. try to think if more data is needed or not.

Plan/Brainstorming:

Get the 25 registered player roster. For every single registered player, get their stats for every player. try to make a data driven decision on my final fpl roster & try to win a league or two.

For new/transfer players for this season maybe try to get the stats from their previous years? <- this will be hard to to do but I think first should focus on premier league only statistics and then later maybe add stats from other leagues and such

Only get 25 players, and only allow for 25 players to registered

So have a constraint that a team_id can only have 25 player_id where registered == true

Fantasty premier league started in 2002 so i have that much data for any currently active players.

datasources - sofascore, footballref, transfermrkt
